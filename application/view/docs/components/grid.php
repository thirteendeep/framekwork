            Create powerful multi-device layouts quickly and easily with the default 12-column, nest-able Foundation grid.

            Start by adding an element with a class of row. This will create a horizontal block to contain vertical columns. Then add divs with a column class within that row. You can use column or columns - the only difference is grammar. Specify the widths of each column with the small-#, medium-#, and large-# classes.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Foundation grid is mobile-first</strong>. Code for small screens first, and larger devices will inherit those styles. Customize for larger screens as necessary.</p>
