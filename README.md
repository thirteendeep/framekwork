Why size your text with EMs in CSS?

Style sheets become easier to maintain because all text set in EMs scale to the body font-size. Only one element's font-size needs to change instead of individually changing the font-size of each element.

Accessibility is increased for end-users because text is scaled based on their preferences rather than set statically in pixels. Additionally, end-users can use hot keys to scale the text in all browsers. Many people have difficulty reading small text on a computer screen.
