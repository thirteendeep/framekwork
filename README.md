# Getting Started with gulp

#### 1. Install gulp globally:

```sh
$ npm install --global gulp
```

#### 2. Install gulp in your project devDependencies:

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev gulp
```

#### 3. Run gulp:

```sh
$ gulp
```

The default task will run and do nothing.

To run individual tasks, use `gulp <task> <othertask>`.

Why size your text with EMs in CSS?

Style sheets become easier to maintain because all text set in EMs scale to the body font-size. Only one element's font-size needs to change instead of individually changing the font-size of each element.

Accessibility is increased for end-users because text is scaled based on their preferences rather than set statically in pixels. Additionally, end-users can use hot keys to scale the text in all browsers. Many people have difficulty reading small text on a computer screen.
